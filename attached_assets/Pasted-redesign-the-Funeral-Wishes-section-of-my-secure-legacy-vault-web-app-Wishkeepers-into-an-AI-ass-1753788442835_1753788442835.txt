redesign the “Funeral Wishes” section of my secure legacy vault web app (Wishkeepers) into an AI-assisted guided flow, replacing the current single text input with a dynamic, conditional-question wizard. The goal is to support users emotionally and practically as they record their final wishes, while tailoring the experience to their beliefs and values.

🎯 Primary Goals
Make the process more supportive and intuitive

Replace the current text box with a step-by-step guided form

Dynamically adjust the flow based on user answers (e.g., religious preferences)

Pre-fill smart suggestions using lightweight AI/local prompts (LLM calls optional, not required for MVP)

🧭 Guided Flow Logic
Initial Question:

“Do you consider yourself religious, spiritual, or neither?”

Option A: Religious → Ask for denomination (e.g., Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, Sikh, etc.)

Option B: Spiritual → Ask if they'd like a spiritual element included (readings, music, nature themes)

Option C: Neither → Skip religious questions and offer secular formats

Branching Based on Response:

For Religious Users:

Preferred faith leader / celebrant

Preferred location of service (e.g. church, mosque, crematorium, etc.)

Any specific readings, rites, traditions (with smart examples)

Dress code preferences (e.g. traditional, white clothing, head covering, etc.)

For Spiritual or Non-Religious Users:

Nature or theme-based preferences (e.g. outdoor, eco-burial, music-driven)

Poems, quotes or songs they'd like

Whether they’d like a celebration of life, or formal service

Common Elements for All:

Burial vs. cremation vs. other (e.g., eco-burial, ashes scattered)

Preferred location for remains

Type of service: formal, informal, private, public

Attendees to include or exclude

Tone: somber, celebratory, humour welcomed?

Any specific people to speak or be involved

Visuals: music, photos, slide shows

Notes for family (e.g. “don’t spend a lot”, “keep it simple”)

🤖 AI Support Features
Provide real-time suggestions based on previous user inputs (e.g. if Christian → offer Bible readings)

Use inline prompts like:

“Many people who identify as [faith] include a [type of ritual] — would you like to include one?”

Show supportive microcopy throughout (e.g. “This can feel hard to think about. Just share what you can.”)

💾 Backend Requirements
Save each step in a JSON schema per user to allow future editing

Encrypt stored data using existing vault encryption model

Allow exporting a summary PDF version of the funeral plan (MVP optional)

💡 Nice-to-Have (Post-MVP / optional)
Use OpenAI (or other LLM) to generate a “funeral summary draft” from user inputs

Allow user to edit the draft directly

Suggest missing fields with kind nudges: “You’ve not chosen music – would you like us to suggest a few ideas?”

Let me know if you’d like me to write:

A JSON schema for this new data structure

The UX content for each step (so it’s warm and non-clinical)
